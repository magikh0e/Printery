# Put Headfit on the site.
#
# Headfit was site/headfit.html in this repo until 2026-09-25, when it moved to
# github.com/magikh0e/headfit. It is a different tool with its own version
# number, it had reached 0.8.1 while the app was on 0.2.30, and none of that was
# visible to anybody, because a file inside someone else's repo has no releases,
# no issues and no page to land on.
#
# It is still served from this site, so a deploy still has to get the file from
# somewhere. That is what this is.
#
#   tools/headfit.sh             fetch it to site/headfit.html
#   tools/headfit.sh --version   print the version it would install, write nothing
#   tools/headfit.sh --deploy    fetch, upload, then read the version back off the site
#
# site/headfit.html is ignored by git here on purpose. It is a copy, and a copy
# you can edit is a copy that gets edited, which is how a fix ends up live and
# nowhere else. Edit it in the headfit checkout and let this bring it over.
