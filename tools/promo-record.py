"""Drive Printery and Headfit through a click path and record it.

Two webm clips into promo/, which tools/promo-build.sh then cuts into the reel.
Recording and composing are separate on purpose: the capture is the slow,
flaky half, and re-cutting titles should not mean re-driving two apps.

Needs both local servers up, which is what .claude/launch.json starts:
    printvault-app  on 9123   the app itself, opened with ?demo
    printvault-site on 9124   serves site/headfit.html

?demo matters. It fills the library with an invented one, so nothing anybody's
real folder contains ends up in a video, and the banner saying so stays on
screen rather than being cropped out.

    py tools/promo-record.py            both
    py tools/promo-record.py headfit    just that one, when a click path changed
