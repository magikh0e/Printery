"""Move each sitemap lastmod on the day its page actually changes.

The sitemap said every page was last modified 2026-09-17 while the home page
was being rewritten and redeployed on every release. lastmod is the one recrawl
signal we control and it was telling Google nothing had happened. Stamping all
three with today's date on every deploy would be the same lie pointed the other
way, and a sitemap whose lastmod is always "now" gets discounted, so this only
moves a date when the bytes behind it move.

"Changed" is decided against site/.sitemap-hashes, a cache of what each page
looked like the last time this ran. It is not tracked, because it describes
this working copy rather than the project, and the first run on a fresh clone
seeds it and stamps nothing: with no idea what the previous content was, any
date it wrote would be a guess.

    python tools/sitemap-stamp.py           stamp what changed
    python tools/sitemap-stamp.py --check   say what it would do, write nothing

Exit codes: 0 nothing moved, 10 the sitemap was rewritten and now needs
uploading, 1 something is wrong. Callers deploy on 10.
