# Move the marketing site onto a new release.
#
# The app is called Printery everywhere a person reads it, but the installers
# are still named PrintVault_*, because productName drives both the filenames
# and the Windows install identity and moving it strands anyone who installed
# from the .exe. So the anchors below track the asset names, not the brand.
#
# The version sits in fourteen places in site/index.html: the JSON-LD
# softwareVersion, the FAQ answer twice, body copy, the footer, six download
# filenames and the two source archive URLs. Six of those are links that carry
# the version in the filename, so the moment a release goes out they all 404
# until this runs.
#
# This used to live inside a mirror script that found the current version by
# grepping href="/dl/<version>/ out of the page. Those links went back to GitHub
# when the account was restored on 2026-09-25, so the anchor stopped existing,
# the step needed a home of its own, and the mirror script has since been
# deleted rather than left around looking like it still runs.
#
#   tools/site-version.sh            move the site to whatever index.html says
#   tools/site-version.sh 0.2.29     move it to that version
#   tools/site-version.sh --deploy   rewrite, verify, then upload the page
#
# It refuses to leave the site pointing at a download that is not there, which
# is the whole point. A blind replace is how the site served 0.2.19 for six
# versions: every link was well formed and every one of them was wrong.
