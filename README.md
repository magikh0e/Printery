I had about 460 files in a folder called "3d print files". Half a dozen
subfolders named "files". No idea which settings I'd used on anything I'd
already printed. When I finally got a proper index of it there were 78 zips
I'd never extracted, holding 414 printable models that nothing had ever shown
me.

This is what I built to dig myself out. It's free, GPL-3.0, and runs either in
your browser or as a desktop app.

## Get it

Nothing to install if you just want to try it: open
[printery.magikh0e.com](https://printery.magikh0e.com/) in Chrome, Edge,
Brave or Opera and point it at a folder.

If you would rather look before handing over a folder, there is a demo at
[/app/?demo](https://printery.magikh0e.com/app/?demo). It fills the app with
an invented library so you can click around. It runs entirely in memory, so it
cannot see or change a real library in the same browser, and it disappears when
you close the tab.

### Thirty seconds of it working

<a href="https://youtu.be/B8cpOXRhWRE"><img src="docs/reel-poster.webp" width="300"
 alt="Printery and Headfit, thirty seconds of it working"></a>

The library, a model with its files and settings, the duplicates, the print log,
then Headfit checking a helmet against a head built from tape measurements.
Filmed against the demo library, so every model in it is invented.

It plays on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/B8cpOXRhWRE) or on [the site](https://printery.magikh0e.com/#reel),
and the file itself is attached to
[the latest release](https://github.com/magikh0e/Printery/releases/latest).
GitHub will not play a video that lives in a repo, which is why this is a poster
and not a player.

There's a guide to [organising a folder full of 3D print files](https://printery.magikh0e.com/guide.html)
if you want the approach before the tool: what to index, how to tag it so the
tags still work at four hundred models, and what to do about the duplicates.

The desktop app is worth it if you have a lot of files, keep them on a network
share, or are tired of re-granting folder access every session. Grab an
installer from
[Releases](https://github.com/magikh0e/Printery/releases):

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `.msi` or `.exe` |
| macOS | `.dmg` (universal, Intel and Apple Silicon) |
| Linux | `.AppImage`, `.deb` or `.rpm` |

The files are still named `PrintVault_*`, and on Windows so is the entry in Add
and Remove Programs. That is deliberate rather than something I forgot. The
`.exe` installer finds your existing copy through a registry entry named after
the product, and the deb and rpm packages key on it too, so renaming it would
install a second copy beside the first and leave the old one behind with a dead
shortcut. If you go looking for Printery in your installed programs, look for
PrintVault.

On Windows the `.msi` and the `.exe` are alternatives rather than options. They
install to the same folder and neither knows the other is there, so running one
over the top of the other leaves two uninstall entries sharing one copy. Pick
either and stay with it.

The builds aren't code signed, because certificates cost more than this
project does. Windows SmartScreen will want "More info" then "Run anyway", and
macOS will want a right-click then Open the first time. If that bothers you,
build it yourself from source below; it's the same thing.

Windows and Linux have both been run against a real library, Linux on Ubuntu.
macOS builds cleanly in CI but nobody has pointed it at a folder yet, so treat
that one as untested and tell me if something breaks.

## What it does

Point it at a folder and it reads what's already there. Nothing gets moved,
renamed, or reorganised into somebody else's idea of a good structure.

It renders a 3D preview for every model, so you're looking at pictures instead
of filenames, and reuses the plate render your slicer already embedded when
there is one.

It pulls settings out of your sliced gcode: time, grams, layer height, nozzle,
infill, material, profile name. Works with PrusaSlicer, OrcaSlicer,
BambuStudio, Creality Print and Cura. Creality Print and Bambu bury the gcode
inside their `.3mf` project files, so it digs that back out. Log a print when
it comes off the bed and the form is already filled in, which means six months
later you can still see what you ran and whether it worked.

It reads inside zips you never extracted, listing and previewing what's in
them without unpacking anything. It'll extract them too, and checksums every
file it writes. The desktop build does the same with 7z, which a browser has
no way of opening.

It finds duplicate downloads and proves they're identical with SHA-256 before
touching anything. By default it moves the copies to a quarantine folder
rather than deleting them, because a browser can't use the Recycle Bin and I
didn't want that on my conscience.

There's filament tracking by what's actually left on the spool, and a print
queue that adds up grams and hours so you know whether you can finish
something before you start it. Start on a queued row sends the file to the
printer rather than just noting that you meant to. If you want the number
first, the cost button works out filament and running cost for however many
copies you're planning.

Everything you type, meaning tags, collections, notes and ratings, exports to
a JSON backup that restores anywhere. It matches on folder name and relative
path rather than internal ids, so moving to a new machine or re-adding the
folder still finds everything. Restore before you scan and the metadata waits
in the database until the files show up.

No account, nothing uploaded, no server involved.

## How it's put together

```
index.html            the whole app, one self-contained file
desktop/              Tauri shell
  build.mjs           copies index.html into dist/, syncs version numbers
  serve.mjs           dev-only static server with correct MIME types
  make-icon.mjs       generates every app icon from raw pixels
  src-tauri/          Rust backend
```

The same `index.html` runs in a browser and inside the desktop shell. It picks
its filesystem layer when it loads, either the File System Access API or
native calls through Tauri, and the other 96% of the code doesn't know or care
which. No build step, no bundler, no dependencies.

Adding `?demo` to the URL is handled the same way, one seam rather than a
parallel code path. The `Demo` module swaps the storage layer for plain `Map`s
before anything opens IndexedDB, then generates a library into it: models,
files, prints, spools, a queue and a few deliberate duplicates. Everything
above that layer runs exactly as it normally does, which is the point. Nothing
is shipped to support it either. The previews are real WebGL renders of meshes
built from primitives in code, so there are no screenshots baked into the file.

Two consequences worth knowing if you're changing it. The demo can't reach a
real library, because `DB.open` never runs, so a visitor poking at the demo
cannot see or overwrite an actual index in the same browser profile. And
anything that touches disk is stubbed to refuse with an explanation, since
there is no folder behind any of it.

## Self-hosting the web version

It's one file, so any static web server will do. From the folder containing
`index.html`:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/. Any other port is fine if that one's taken.

It has to be served, not opened directly. A `file://` path won't work, because
browsers only hand out folder access in a secure context, meaning `https` or
`localhost`. Chromium only for the folder part (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera),
since Firefox and Safari don't implement the API.

## Building the desktop app

You need [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and Node 20+. On Linux you also need the
WebKitGTK development packages:

```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libssl-dev
```

Then:

```bash
cd desktop
npm install
npm run tauri:dev      # with frontend hot reload
npm run tauri:build    # installers land in src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```

There's no frontend build step. `build.mjs` copies `index.html` into `dist/`
and stamps its version into the shell, so the two can't drift. Icons are
generated by `make-icon.mjs` rather than committed, so if `tauri:build`
complains about a missing icon, run that first.

`tauri:dev` serves the frontend through `serve.mjs` rather than Tauri's own dev
server, which hands `index.html` back as `application/octet-stream` and leaves
WebView2 showing a blank window.

## Why bother with the desktop build

Almost everything annoying about the browser version is the browser, not the
app.

Browsers forget folder access between sessions, so every visit starts by
clicking Scan to re-grant it. Roots are stored as paths here, and paths
survive a restart.

Speed is the bigger one. A browser has to open every file individually just to
learn how big it is. One Rust call returns the whole listing with sizes and
timestamps, which on a network share is the difference between minutes and
seconds.

Archives are unpacked in Rust too, so entry bytes never cross into JavaScript.
That fixes large entries running the browser out of memory, and gets you bzip2
and zstd, which browsers can't inflate at all.

And Firefox and Safari don't implement the File System Access API, so the web
version can't work there no matter what. The desktop build doesn't care.

## Headfit

There's a second tool that came out of this one:
[Headfit](https://github.com/magikh0e/headfit), a helmet and mask fit bench.
Build a head from three tape measurements, load the STL you were about to
print, and see where the two collide before you spend eight hours, or three
days, of filament finding out. It's one HTML file like this one, it runs at
[printery.magikh0e.com/headfit.html](https://printery.magikh0e.com/headfit.html),
and Settings in here has a button that opens it.

It lives in its own repo. It's a separate tool on its own version number and
nothing in it depends on Printery, but the site serves both, so
`tools/headfit.sh` fetches the file when a deploy needs it.

## Support

Free and open source, built and maintained in my own time, with no accounts,
tracking or ads. If it's saved you a failed print or a few gigabytes, a beer
helps keep it going.
